  </h2>

  <h3><a href="https://mafer1017.github.io/vacation-site/">Vacation website</a></h3>
  <p>This was a project that involved creating a fictional vacation website about anywhere in the world. I chose to create a satirical one for my lovely hometown of <em>Portland, Oregon</em>. I used both HTML and CSS languages to create it. </p>

  <h3><a href="https://mafer1017.github.io/band/">Favorite Band:</a></h3>
  <p>This is a webpage I developed about one of my favorite bands at the moment. I used HTML and CSS to develop the page.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://mafer1017.github.io/section-in-review/">Section In Review</a></h3>
  <p>This is a webpage that I created to help test some of the coding tools and technologies I had learned thus far in the program at Epicodus, which included HTML, CSS, and MARKDOWN.</p>
