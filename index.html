  <p>Here are a few exmaples of projects that I have worked on thus far</p>

  <h1>Vacation website</h1>
  <p>This was a project that involved creating a fictional vacation website about anywhere in the world. I chose to create a satirical one for my lovely hometown of Portland, Oregon. I used both HTML and CSS languages to create it. </p>
